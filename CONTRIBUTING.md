When contributing to this Project, please ensure, that you follow the directions of the following guideline. This will make communication between contributors easier and enables me, the Owner, to review your requests faster.

- Eventhough the current Language of the Program is German, please use english variable Names and documentation. This will ensure, that more people can understand the code.
- As this is more of a free-time project of mine, please don't expect me to respond to your question or request immediately, as there might be reasons for that. I will try to respond to every request, so don't take this personally.
- This is right now customized for a single User, as this was requested by him. As long as I don't start to make an universal version of this Project, please don't change values of the variables or alter the calculation, as this is fitted for a single problem, not for all problems of this type.
